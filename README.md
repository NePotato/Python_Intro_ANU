# Python_Intro_ANU
python notebooks and example data for bioinformatics-bash-python course run for RSB at ANU

This material has adapted but is based on lessons take from:
https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/

The notebook was originally authored by Sylvain Foret and Kevin Murray (kdmurray91)

I can recommend Practical Computing for Biologists by Haddock and Dunn as a source for additional learning
